				My journey into programming started in 2015 when a college friend handed me a Python development book.
				Little did he know that he would spark a lifetime of continuous learning and endless creation. Since
				then, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects spanning from established
				software development firms to cutting edge startups. I also built and maintain my own SaaS product that
				helps music makers improve their quality of life

				Currently I am working as a freelance developer. My main focus is set on helping innovators and creators
				bring their vision to life through developing elegant, fast, and efficient web applications. My approach
				is rooted in a strong focus on user experience, coupled with a keen attention to detail in understanding
				and executing the client's vision.
